# Version Control that Works Today: Git & GitHub with CI

This workshop will get you hands on with foundational tools leveraged across the software industry. You, with guidance from industry professionals, will apply these tools and practices to your own homework or projects and by the end, you'll have:

- A real GitHub repository with meaningful history
- A `.gitignore` file that keeps junk out
- Automated builds that run on every push
- A status badge that shows your project is healthy
- Automated releases that run on pushes to your main branch
- Confidence to use Git & GitHub in your coursework and beyond
- Start building out your GitHub heatmap (employers do look at this!)

## Learning Goals

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- **Distinguish** Git (local version control) from GitHub (remote hosting & collaboration)
- **Explain** why version control matters for your coursework and future career
- **Initialize** repos, make commits, and push to GitHub using the `gh` CLI
- **Create** targeted `.gitignore` files for your tech stack
- **Wire up** GitHub Actions to automatically validate your projects
- **Add** status badges that signal project health to collaborators and recruiters
